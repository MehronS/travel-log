Travel Log is an application to store pictures of coutnries you have been to and an easy way to render out pictures of those specific places. It is also to help you plan trips to places you want to visit with relevant links and information such as Safety Levels, Covid Levels, AirBNB, Setting up guides... etc. 

## Usage

1. Go to the deployment link (above) and create an account
2. Click countries you have been to or want to visit on the map to create a little flag. You can also enter the country name on the top left search bar
3. Click open the flag on any country to go into the country page. This is where you can upload your photos or plan a trip.

Anytime you want to see your photos of a specific country, you can just open that country from the world map and they will render for you. 

## Tech Stack

1. React and Redux for the front end
2. Node.Js, Express, Sequelize/PostgreSQL for the backend. 
3. Leaflet libraries combined with Roadgoat API and REST Countries API to provide information
